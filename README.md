# 🧑‍💼 Laravel Job Portal System

A feature-rich Job Portal web application developed using PHP Laravel during my internship period as part of a collaborative team project.  
The system enables applicants to explore job circulars, apply for positions, and track their application progress — all built with scalable architecture and real-world business logic in mind.  

## 🚀 Features  

- User Registration & Login (Applicant-focused)  
- View and filter job circulars based on nature (full-time, part-time, etc.)  
- Apply for jobs through the portal  
- Track applicant activities (application status, logs)  
- Admin/HR functionality to post, update, and manage job circulars  
- Role-based access and activity logging
